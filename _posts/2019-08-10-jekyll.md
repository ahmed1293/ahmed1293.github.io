This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), with the [Duo](https://github.com/chibicode/duo) theme.

I created it for the learning experience - it was pretty fun and painless. I don't think I'll be doing much blogging, but it's cool how easy it is to go from zero to your own blog. The content on the homepage is all in [README.md](https://github.com/ahmedaljawahiry/ahmed1293.github.io/blob/master/README.md); adding a blog post is as simple as adding a `.md` file to
`_posts/`, like [so](https://github.com/ahmedaljawahiry/ahmed1293.github.io/tree/master/_posts); and most of the template logic is in [default.html](https://github.com/ahmed1293/ahmed1293.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/default.html).
